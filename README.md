# Advanced Perception & Sensing for Autonomous Systems

## Overview
This is an ongoing project focused on perception and sensing for autonomous systems.
The work is being migrated from USRP, GNU Radio, and MATLAB to Python, with plans to later extend parts of the project to C++.

## Current Status
- Python-based development
- Signal processing and sensing experiments
- Actively under development

## Motivation
This project serves as a personal research and development playground to build strong foundations in automotive radar, perception, and sensing. The goal is gradually move from prototyping in Python to efficient and deployable implementations in C++.
